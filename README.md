# JavaScript To-Do List Project

This is a simple To-Do List project built using JavaScript. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks can be marked as completed or pending, and users can filter tasks based on their status. The application also provides a clear-all button to remove all tasks.
